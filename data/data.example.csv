1,5,This site is helpful with networking and visibility. I am getting resume reviews weekly. Overall LinkedIn is one of better job search sites. I recommend it to anyone in the job search situation.
2,5,"I made an account and used it to apply for jobs and search for jobs that might interest me later. It was nice to be able to look for specific jobs and also link to others you know and see where they can help. It was easy to find jobs and review them but the site itself and navigating though it was very Confusing. It needs better tutorial to get around the site. It should have more help getting you to get used to it. But, I love that I could save my searches and also love the Resume help."
3,5,"ginal review: June 29, 2020
For the most part LinkedIn (paid subscription) is my go to Job search app. However the 2 things I find difficult & frustrating are:

1. ability to filter for REMOTE positions (& the variations of remote, 100% Anywhere in US, State specific, partial remote etc)
2. ability to easily filter or see which jobs posted via a Recruiter (usually same job posted by many recruiters) vs posted by actual hiring Company. While I am open to working via a recruiting agency I've found they ONLY have my interests in mind when they happen to have a position that by chance I match up with. In no way have experienced or found a Recruiter who works with ME that matches MY skills to a job. I would pay for this service, IF I could find, which I can't if it is a real thing.

What I like: ability to Quick Apply with maybe 2 or 3 job specific questions, which I find occasionally, More often I'm direct to a companies or recruiter site that even when using linked in connect to prefill, I still need to copy and paste or correct 85% of my info into. I love the Company or application insight information, ie # of applicants, salary ranges, etc."
4,5,Great Website. A real industry leader and asset App. I really like their mobile App. as well. It would be greatly appreciated if they could send virtual business cards. LinkedIn spends a great of time and effort in updating its app. and keeping current with the times.
5,5,"I highly recommend everyone to check out LinkedIn especially if you're searching for employment. Even people that are already employed can benefit from this website and what all it has to offer. It is very similar to a social network but one that is focused around jobs. It is very easy to connect with others individually and as a company as well. With LinkedIn you can find employment by searching the available jobs posted and applying to them. Between the specific categories and the filters available, searching for any job, anywhere is super easy and it actually has a lot of legitimate opportunities available."
6,5,I used LinkedIn to determine companies of possible opportunities. I wanted to determine if I would be a good fit. Could see who searched for me. Had an existing account. Relatively easy process. LinkedIn is pretty good and helps to stay in touch with coworkers and classmates. I liked that I could see friends and former colleagues' recommendations. But there are too many recruiters getting my information and suggested jobs aren't relevant to my experience. Needs to consider most recent experience in algorithms to determine job interests.
7,5,LinkedIn is an amazing website to connect with like-minded people and professionals. You can do a search for a business or a person. I find it really helpful when advertising my business and connecting with people from all over the world. I really like the fact that I can read articles and magazines for free and they're so educational and informative. I’ve made some amazing connections with organizations and was able to network with people and that’s how I was able to find my amazing career.
8,5,"I made my own account in LinkedIn and it was simple. It is also easy to find job listings. I have not used the site to apply but I have looked at positions on LinkedIn. I like how it connects me with others that I know, gives me potential contacts of my friends and suggests new people to link me with as well. It also allows me to stay in contact with people I know and know what they are doing in life. It has been a simple website to use.

9,5,"I like LinkedIn because it seems to be a bit more personal. You can look at companies and the profiles of people working there and they can learn more about you from your profile. It is also good to see who you both know, which can gives you a little insight into the people they choose to associate with. While not a character reference, you get a feel for the person you may be interacting with. I also like LinkedIn because people who are really looking for someone with your talents are reaching out, rather than the randomly applying to robots who may or may not have their algorithms set for the words and phrases in your resume."
10,5,Big company and large networks. Provides employee and employer (hiring) professional history and background. High profile employers and colleges can reach you in future by looking at your current profile.
11,5,I really enjoyed being able to make a profile that was similar to a resume where you can connect with businesses and possibly find your new career that best fits you. I did use the site to find employment opportunities within my field and was able to connect with a wide range of people within the industry which my degree is geared to. It was quite easy to navigate within the site. It was a pleasant experience.
12,5,"I have an account and have been a member for about five years. It is simple to find places that are looking for experienced professionals and where to submit a resume. I have not had to use the site to apply for a position as I am firmly entrenched in a position within my preferred career field. However, it is a great way to network and meet new people who share the same career as yourself. I have met a number of people who have similar work experience to myself and are exploring a second career. I will need a second career at the age of 49 and this is a great way to find it. I personally have no complaints about this website. I have learned much about what I can do after my first career is complete. This website is doing exactly what it was meant to. The only thing is that some people use this as a way to find a relationship or find a life companion, which is a bit ridiculous."
13,5,"Linked in is a great way to network with other professionals and to find people with common interests, and even quite possibly to secure new work. The downside is that many businesses use the site as a marketing platform without much regard for the consumer. At times people may be a bit too aggressive in hawking their products or services. I use the site to post pithy news articles and commentaries about the issues of the day and many people enjoy seeing these articles as I cull them from publications most users may never see. I stay in touch with a small circle of fellow writers and that functions as a support groups. I also share helpful tips."
14,5,"I love LinkedIn Jobs for the tailored job recommendations and the easy INApply feature. I have actually found a couple of jobs through it. It is very convenient to open your profile up to recruiters and tell your network that you are seeking employment. I like how your profile is shared with those you are applying with, especially since I have a ton of recommendations! If I could change one thing, it would be the same job sent to me over and over again. I get excited that there is a new recommendation and then, when I apply, it tells me ""you've already applied"". All in all, I often find a better quality job on LinkedIn and would recommend it."
